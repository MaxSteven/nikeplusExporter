Usage
-----
Just enter `python client.py` followed by the following arguments:
- email address
- start date
- end date

Optional arguments are `--debug`, which will spew out data in the prompt and `-h`, which will show all arguments.

Example: `python client.py john.doe@gmail.com 2012-01-01 2013-01-01` â€“ this will download all workouts throughout the year (this will take a while if you're a frequent runner). 

You will be prompted for your password each time you execute client.py. All workouts will be downloaded into a folder called "archive" and all TCX conversions will end up in a folder called "export".
